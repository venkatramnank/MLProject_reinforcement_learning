# MLProject_reinforcement_learning
This repo contains code for Shortest distance using Q Learning and Dynamic Modeling of Segway using Q Learning.
This is done as project work for the course Machine Learning.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- Packages : gym,matplotlib,numpy
- OS preferably: Ubuntu
Note: Please download all openai simulation code from their Github website. Please follow the instructions given in that website properly.
Note: Mujoco needs License. Go to Openai Mujoco docs to install with license.

## OpenAI Simulations
Here are some of the simulations done using OpenAI GYM environment as a part of Learning the concepts of RL.

 ## Shortest path using Q Learning
  
The shortest path using Q learning is an example of RL solving Combinatorial optimization problems. It is usually applied for many situations like Delivery and Routing. 

Given below is image of Q matrix and learning curve for a given graph of routers.

 The below graph shows the comparison wrt Dijkstra shortest path time.***

 *** For larger graphs Q learning takes quite some time. In such cases we use Deep Q Learning.
 
 ## Dynamic Modeling of Segways using Q Learning
 Segways can be seen as inverted pendulum structures. Q Learning can be used to balance them.
 
 After 10 iterations we can see the following

 After 200 iterations we can see the following

 The rewards with respect to 10000 iterations are explained in this graph.
