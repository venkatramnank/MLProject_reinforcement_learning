# MLProject_reinforcement_learning
This repo contains code for Shortest distance using Q Learning and Dynamic Modeling of Segway using Q Learning.
This is done as project work for the courrse Machine Learning.

## OpenAI Simulations
Here are some of the simulations done using OpenAI GYM environment as a part of Learning the concepts of RL.

 ## Shortest path using Q Learning
  
The shortest path using Q learning is an example of RL solving Combinatorial optimization problems. It is usually applied for many situations like Delivery and Routing. 

Given below is image of Q matrix and learning curve for a given graph of routers.

 The below graph shows the comparison wrt Dijkstra shortest path time.***

 *** For larger graphs Q learning takes quite some time. In such cases we use Deep Q Learning.
